//! Platform-adaptive marker traits for cross-platform compatibility.
//!
//! These traits enable unified handler definitions that work on both native and WASM targets.
//! On native targets, the traits require `Send`/`Sync` bounds for multi-threaded executors.
//! On WASM targets, the traits have no bounds since WASM is single-threaded and `JsValue` is `!Send`.
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! The fundamental challenge for unified native/WASM code is that `wasm_bindgen::JsValue`
//! is `!Send` by design due to JavaScript's slab-based object management. This has
//! "huge trickle-down effects" on downstream crates.
//!
//! The solution is conditional compilation with marker traits that adapt to the target.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use turbomcp_core::{MaybeSend, MaybeSync};
//!
//! // This trait works on both native (with Send) and WASM (without Send)
//! trait MyHandler: MaybeSend + MaybeSync {
//!     fn handle(&self) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + MaybeSend;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Platform Behavior
//!
//! - **Native (`x86_64`, `aarch64`, etc.)**: `MaybeSend` requires `Send`, `MaybeSync` requires `Sync`
//! - **WASM (`wasm32`)**: Both traits are blanket-implemented for all types (no bounds)

/// Marker trait that requires `Send` on native targets, nothing on WASM.
///
/// This enables unified trait definitions that work on both platforms:
/// - On native: futures must be `Send` for multi-threaded executors like tokio
/// - On WASM: no `Send` bound needed since WASM is single-threaded
///

/// ```rust,ignore

/// use std::future::Future;

/// trait MyAsyncTrait {
