//! The transport ↔ service driver loop.
//!
//! [`serve`] reads frames from a [`Transport`], runs each through an
//! [`McpService`] (the dispatcher, wrapped in whatever middleware), and writes
//! back any response. Notifications (service returns `None`) produce no write.
//!
//! ## Concurrency model (the single-writer-actor)
//!
//! A slow handler must not head-of-line-block the reader, and outbound frames
//! must never interleave on the wire. The driver therefore separates the two
//! halves:
//!
//! - **Reader / dispatch:** each inbound frame is handed to a *cloned* service
//!   on its own spawned task, so N requests are in flight concurrently.
//! - **Writer actor:** every task funnels its response through a single
//!   `mpsc` channel, and one arm of the [`tokio::select!`] loop is the sole
//!   writer to the transport — frames are serialized, never interleaved. The
//!   `mpsc::Sender` is the seam Phase 6 clones into the subscription registry so
//!   server-initiated notifications share the same ordered writer.
//!
//! **Backpressure** is a [`Semaphore`] sized to `max_in_flight`: the reader
//! parks on `acquire` once that many handlers are outstanding, which (on stdio's
//! single process) naturally serializes load instead of unbounded-spawning.
//!
//! **Graceful shutdown** (PLAN §4.13): firing the configured
//! [`CancellationToken`] stops the reader, then in-flight handlers are given
//! `drain_timeout` to finish and flush their replies before the transport is
//! closed; stragglers past the deadline are aborted.
//!
//! ## The driver is the trust boundary
//!
//! The driver is the first code to see a frame off the wire, so it owns the
//! internal-`_meta` hygiene ([`meta::sanitize_inbound`]): forged
//! `io.turbomcp.internal/*` keys are stripped, then the driver asserts its own
//! [`meta::internal::CONNECTION_ID`] (one id per `serve` call). Layers below
//! (session adapter, dispatcher) trust internal keys — they must always sit
//! under a sanitizing boundary like this driver or the HTTP endpoint.
