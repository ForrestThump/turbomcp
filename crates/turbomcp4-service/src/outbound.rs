//! Per-connection ordered writers — the server-initiated-message push seam.
//!
//! The `serve` driver's writer actor is the only thing allowed to write a
//! connection's transport (invariant 13). For server-initiated messages
//! (subscription notifications, bidirectional requests) the rest of the stack
//! needs a way to reach that writer: this table maps the driver-minted
//! connection id (see [`turbomcp4_core::meta::internal::CONNECTION_ID`]) to a
//! clone of the writer's `mpsc::Sender`.
//!
//! - The `serve` driver [`register`]s its sender for the connection's lifetime
//!   (the guard unregisters before the drain phase, so the channel can close).
//! - The HTTP transport registers a per-stream sender for SSE responses under
//!   its own minted id.
//! - The dispatcher resolves [`writer`] lazily at publish time: a missing
//!   entry means the connection is gone and the subscription with it.
//!
//! Entries are process-local bookkeeping, never wire data; ids are unique per
//! process, so two connections can never collide.
