//! The [`Transport`] trait: a bidirectional [`JsonRpcMessage`] channel.
//!
//! Transports own framing (line-delimited for stdio, SSE-event-framed for HTTP)
//! and hand the codec complete frames. The serve loop drives a `Transport`
//! directly, so the trait uses return-position `impl Future` (native AFIT/RPITIT)
//! rather than boxed futures — no per-message allocation, fully monomorphized.
//!
//! # The production parity contract
//!
//! Every bundled server transport — stdio (`turbomcp-transport-stdio`),
//! WebSocket (`turbomcp-transport-ws`), and Streamable HTTP
//! (`turbomcp-transport-http`, a runner rather than a `Transport`) — must
//! uphold the same production guarantees. A new transport (or a change to one)
//! is held to this checklist:
//!
//! 1. **Trust boundary.** Client input passes
//!    [`meta::sanitize_inbound`](turbomcp_core::meta::sanitize_inbound) before
//!    any internal `_meta` key (`connectionId`, `sessionId`, `identity`) is
//!    injected — a client can never forge them. The serve driver does this for
//!    `Transport`-based servers; HTTP does it in its endpoint.
//! 2. **Authentication seam.** Where the deployment is network-reachable, the
//!    [`HttpAuthenticator`](crate::HttpAuthenticator) seam validates a bearer
//!    credential (per request on HTTP; at the upgrade for WebSocket, with the
//!    principal carried per-connection via [`ServeConfig::identity`](crate::ServeConfig)).
//!    stdio is a trusted local channel (a launcher owns both pipe ends); use a
//!    network transport when the deployment is reachable.
//! 3. **Cross-origin defense.** Browser-reachable endpoints validate `Origin`
//!    (HTTP requests, WebSocket upgrades) — default-deny with an allowlist.
//! 4. **Bounded input.** A size cap on inbound payloads: HTTP body limit, WS
//!    message limit, and the stdio line transport's per-frame cap
//!    (`LineTransport::with_max_line_bytes`, defaulting to
//!    `DEFAULT_MAX_LINE_BYTES`) — a peer that never sends `\n` is refused, not
//!    buffered without bound.
//! 5. **Liveness + shutdown.** Long-lived channels keep intermediaries alive
//!    (SSE keep-alive comments, WS idle pings) *and* reap peers that go silent
//!    (WS closes after `max_idle_pings` unanswered probes), and honor the
//!    shutdown token: accept loops stop, in-flight handlers drain within the
//!    configured deadline, `subscriptions/listen` streams close gracefully.
//! 6. **Backpressure.** Inbound dispatch is bounded (`max_in_flight` in the
//!    serve driver; connection/request limits in the HTTP stack) so a fast
//!    peer cannot grow memory without bound.
//! 7. **TLS.** Terminate at the ingress/proxy, or layer a TLS stream under the
//!    transport (`WebSocketTransport::accept` / `LineTransport::new` take any
//!    byte stream). No transport hand-rolls crypto.
