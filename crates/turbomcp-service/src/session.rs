//! The session-termination seam.
//!
//! The `2025-11-25` Streamable HTTP transport lets a client end a session with
//! an HTTP `DELETE` (spec §Session Management). The session table lives in the
//! server layer (`turbomcp-server`), which the HTTP transport doesn't depend
//! on — so, like [auth](crate::HttpAuthenticator), termination crosses the
//! boundary through a small `service`-level trait the server implements and the
//! transport holds behind `Arc<dyn …>`.
