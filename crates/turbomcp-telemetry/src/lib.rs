//! # turbomcp-telemetry
//!
//! OpenTelemetry observability for TurboMCP v4: a transport-agnostic
//! [`TraceContextLayer`] that continues the caller's W3C distributed trace
//! (propagated over MCP `_meta`, SEP-414) and records **PII-safe** identity
//! attributes on each request span, plus an optional turnkey OTLP export
//! pipeline (feature `otlp`).
//!
//! ## Compose the layer
//!
//! [`TraceContextLayer`] is a [`tower::Layer`] over `Service<JsonRpcMessage>`,
//! so it wraps a dispatcher like any shared RPC middleware and works identically
//! under stdio, HTTP, and WS:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use tower::Layer;
//! use turbomcp_telemetry::TraceContextLayer;
//!
//! let traced = TraceContextLayer::new().layer(dispatcher);
//! // serve `traced` over any transport.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Redaction
//!
//! By default a span records the caller's subject as a stable, non-reversible
//! hash ([`RedactedSubject`](turbomcp_core::RedactedSubject)) and the claim
//! *keys* only — never claim values — so emails/org-ids in a JWT never reach
//! telemetry. Opt into raw subjects with [`SpanPolicy::unredacted`].
//!
//! ## Export
//!
//! With the `otlp` feature, [`init_otlp`] builds an OTLP/gRPC exporter and
//! installs a `tracing` subscriber that exports the layer's spans. Without it,
//! the spans flow to whatever `tracing` subscriber the host installs.
