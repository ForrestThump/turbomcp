//! The OAuth 2.1 **client** half (feature `oauth-client`): everything an MCP
//! client needs to obtain and maintain tokens for a protected MCP server, per
//! the MCP authorization spec.
//!
//! - [`challenge`] — `WWW-Authenticate` Bearer parsing (401/403, step-up)
//! - [`discovery`] — RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata + RFC 8414/OIDC
//!   authorization-server metadata, in the spec's mandatory endpoint order,
//!   with issuer validation and the PKCE MUST-refuse rule
//! - [`registration`] — pre-registered / Client ID Metadata Documents /
//!   RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration (with `application_type`)
//! - [`store`] — the issuer-keyed [`CredentialStore`] (spec §Authorization
//!   Server Binding)
//! - [`flow`] — [`OAuthClient`]: PKCE authorization-code flow, RFC 8707
//!   `resource` on every request, RFC 9207 `iss` validation, refresh,
//!   scope step-up
//!
//! The interactive step is the embedding application's: [`OAuthClient::begin`]
//! returns the URL to open; the redirect callback goes to
//! [`OAuthClient::complete`].
