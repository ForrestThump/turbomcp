//! Client-side error model (`ClientCallError` in PLAN §4.10).
//!
//! A client call fails in one of a few visible ways: the peer answered with a
//! JSON-RPC error, the connection went away, the call timed out, or a
//! successful result didn't deserialize into the type the typed API expected.
//! These are distinct enough to branch on, so they're separate variants rather
//! than one stringly error.
