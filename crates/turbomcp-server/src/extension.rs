//! The [`Extension`] seam: a multi-method server plugin (PLAN D10).
//!
//! An extension owns a set of request methods (e.g. the draft Tasks extension's
//! `tasks/get`/`tasks/update`/`tasks/cancel`), advertises itself in
//! `server/discover` under `capabilities.extensions[id]`, and is dispatched by
//! the [`VersionDispatcher`](crate::VersionDispatcher) on the modern
//! (`2026-07-28`) path once the client has declared the extension in its
//! per-request capabilities.
//!
//! Extensions are **draft-only**: the legacy `2025-11-25` path serves its
//! built-in equivalents (core Tasks) instead. The trait is object-safe and
//! dispatched behind `Arc<dyn Extension>`, so extensions live in their own
//! crates (e.g. `turbomcp-ext-tasks`) and register via
//! [`ServerBuilder::with_extension`](crate::ServerBuilder::with_extension) /
//! [`VersionDispatcher::with_extension`](crate::VersionDispatcher::with_extension).
//!
//! The trait is the durable architectural asset; the D10 sketch's
//! `intercept_response`/`notification_topics` are folded into the real seams an
//! extension actually needs — [`dispatch`](Extension::dispatch) for its owned
//! methods, and (Phase 9b) a task-augmentation hook for `tools/call` — rather
//! than modeled as standalone trait methods with no consumer.
